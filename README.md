# Fourier Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN)
This repository provides code free to use, for any applications.<br>
The implementations of the different layers needed to build and train FCNN has been provided such as :
- Fourier convolution layers
- Fourier pooling layer
- PhaseReLU activation function
- FFT and IFFT layer
<br>
An example of spatial CNN and its FCNN equivalen has also been provided
